Background
----------

Originally we had Allmon to manage Allstar nodes. Allmon is basic and is limiting in finctionality. Then along came SuperMon. SuperMon is a great tool, but like many things in the amateur radio community it still has a user interface of something designed in the late 1990's or early 2000's. Also it is written in PHP, which now days is a very difficult language to work with. In an effort to update the user expereince and to make the code base more friendly to modify and extend, a journey to create YAAM was started.
